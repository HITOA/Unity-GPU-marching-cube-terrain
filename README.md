# Unity-GPU-marching-cube-terrain

Small repo to host a test project i made on unity : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SuDjiR1sNM
There is for sure some dirty things, not used texture, weird things in script or things like that, because it's a test project.
The goal of this projet was to see how far i can take marching cube for terrain in game i guess ?

This is not the whole unity project, because (for the cloud) there is a package that i obviously can't share.
You can probably just put the game folder in ur assets folder, fix some things, and run it ?
